          <h1>This is my home page!!!</h1>
          <br>Sorry,my website is still under construction.<br>
My job as a facilities maintenance engineer required a wide range of skills. <br>
One day I might have to fix the furnace, <br>
while the next day could see me painting the CEO’s office.<br>
 When I described it to a ­coworker as “I’m a jack of all trades, master of none,” <br>
 I was amused, yet slightly offended, <br>
 when she offered a less than complimentary interpretation from her native Cantonese: <br>
“Equipped with knives all over, yet none are very sharp.” 
<br>
At the doctor’s office, a 20-something man was trying to make an appointment for a Mrs. Brown. 
Try as he might, he just could not remember her first name. 
Frustrated, he left. 
A few minutes later, 
I passed him outside the office on the phone.“Hey, Dad,” he said. 
“What’s Mom’s first name?”
